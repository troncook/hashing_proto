# hashing_proto

quick demo of hashing using SHA-256 family of algorithms. 
recuiters.csv is the initial dataset, hashing_prototype_2 is a notebook that hashes the id and another example of combining two columns to hash for added protection. The hash2.csv is the result and hash_combined_columns is the result of the second process of combining two columns to get a unique id.
